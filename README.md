# Networking Labs

This repository contains hands-on networking labs primarily aligned with the CCNA syllabus.  
The goal is to build deep, practical understanding of how networks actually work, not just how to pass an exam.

## What this repository is
- Step-by-step networking labs with clear explanations
- Focus on Layer 2 and Layer 3 fundamentals
- Each lab explains *why* configurations exist, not just the commands

## Topics covered
- Switching fundamentals (VLANs, trunking, DTP)
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP, RSTP, Cisco variants)
- EtherChannel
- Routing fundamentals (static routing, inter-VLAN routing)
- Basic troubleshooting scenarios

## Structure
Labs are organised by topic and certification area:
networking-labs/
├── ccna/
│   ├── vlan-basics/
│   ├── trunking-dtp/
│   ├── spanning-tree/
│   ├── etherchannel/
│   └── routing-basics/
Each folder contains a README explaining the lab, the topology, and the reasoning behind each step.
