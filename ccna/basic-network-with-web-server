# Basic Network with Web Server

## Lab Goal
The goal of this lab is to demonstrate basic network communication within a single local area network (LAN).

This lab focuses on how end devices communicate through a switch and how clients can access a web server on the same network.

## Topology Overview
The network consists of:
- One Layer 2 switch
- Two client PCs
- One web server
- One network printer

All devices are connected to the same switch and are part of the same IP subnet.

## IP Addressing
All devices are configured in the `192.168.1.0/24` network:

- PC1: `192.168.1.1`
- PC2: `192.168.1.2`
- Web Server: `192.168.1.3`
- Printer: `192.168.1.4`

The server and printer use static IP addresses, which is best practice for devices providing network services.

## How Communication Works
When PC1 accesses the web server at `http://192.168.1.3`:

1. PC1 confirms the destination IP is in the same subnet.
2. PC1 uses ARP to resolve the server’s MAC address.
3. The switch forwards frames based on learned MAC addresses.
4. The web server receives the HTTP request and responds with the web page.

Because all devices are in the same LAN, no router is required.

## Verification
Connectivity was verified by successfully accessing the web server from PC1 using a web browser.

## CCNA Relevance
This lab reinforces key CCNA fundamentals:
- IP addressing and subnet
